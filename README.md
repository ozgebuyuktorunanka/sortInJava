# Insertion Sort Project

This project demonstrates the Insertion Sort algorithm with step-by-step output.

## Big-O Notation

Worst Case: O(n^2)  
Best Case: O(n)  
Average Case: O(n^2)  

## Time Complexity Case for value 18:

Average Case (because it's located somewhere in the middle of the sorted array).
